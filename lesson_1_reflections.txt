Notes from

Use the diff command to see the the difference between two files
diif -u <file0> <file1>

Having access to the history of a file woud allow reverting back to specific files

Commits
Each commit has an id
Author
Date
Comment


git diff <old_file> <new_file>

Commit Rules
one commit per logical change. For example, if you fixed a typo, then fixed a bug in a separate part of the file, you should use one commit for each change since they are logically separate. If you do this, each commit will have one purpose that can be easily understood. Git allows you to write a short message explaining what was changed in each commit, and that message will be more useful if each commit has a single logical change.

Repository
A collection of files are stored in a repository

A commit is a snapshot

Number of + and - shows the number of commits

Git clone
clones and entire repository

clone a repository
from the directory to clone to:
git clone <address of repository to clone>
e.g.
git clone https://github.com/udacity/asteroids.git

to check the log of changes:
git log

to find the difference between two files:
git diff <id new change> <id old change>
