When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you would like to:
- Access the repository from a separate location / computer.
- Make modifications to the repository from a different location / computer.
- Share the work / collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you would only want to share a working version of the work and not all its intermediate states.
