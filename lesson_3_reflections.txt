When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you would like to:
- Access the repository from a separate location / computer.
- Make modifications to the repository from a different location / computer.
- Share the work / collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you would only want to share a working version of the work and not all its intermediate states.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - cloning a repository on GitHub to your personal account on GitHub.
Cloning - cloning a repository from anywhere to your local computer.
Branches - Repositories have branches when they have been 'branched'

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can monitor or check what has been changed in the remote repository
