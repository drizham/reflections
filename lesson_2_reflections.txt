What happens when you initialize a repository? (git init)
Why do you need to do it?
To get git monitoring the repository.
To monitor the files in the repository when committed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Staging area tells git what to monitor but is not yet committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
When files are added to the staging area only one change should be implement at a time.
Once the changes have been made and tested only then should they be commited.
*Looks like best to commit a file/s that only have been changed

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
- Branch off when making experiments or major changes.
- Doing something different.
Master Branch - Keep this as the 'Production Quality Branch'

The 'detached Head' message
You get this when a 'commit' is checked out.
*not a branch!

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits create it by using:
git checkout -b new_branch_name

This is equilvalent to these two commands:
git branch new_branch_name
git checkout new_brabch_name
